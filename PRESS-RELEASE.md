## For people who find email slow and chats chaotic

The number one productivity pain point in any organization is communication. Slick will allow you to become more productive than ever by allowing you to communicate at the speed of thought.

### Problem
Have you ever run into an email and think, "I'll respond to this later"? Maybe you will, maybe you wont. With chat, you can respond in an instant, but the conversation could get lost in a sea of messages.

### Solution
Slick provides a way for you to organize your chats into searchable emailesque threads. Now you can sift through your chats without ever getting lost.
